   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sandy has basically shutdown NYC and the tri state area. I figured I would use the extra time at home to get my blog going. First, I need to setup the infrastructure. Since I already have a rails app, I thought it made sense to go with Jekyll for a simple static blog. It was very simple to get going, and it's forcing me to get familiar with markdown.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Hello World - About me and this site</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;About Me&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I double concentrated in computer science &amp;amp; math at Columbia College in NYC. I concentrated in Math and Computer Science. A concentration is more like a minor than a major. With that said, most of the valuable stuff comes from work and few a key courses like Data Structures. Self education was key, and the best investment I ever made was in the CLRS textbook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;About the Site&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of my experience is in finance, specifically building trading systems. This means I have worked on exchange execution, desktop UIs, P&amp;amp;L tools, logistics tools, and plenty of other custom technologies to support a trading business. This means most of my experiences is in proprietary technologies, Java, and C#.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I built this site to develop experience with web applications, but more importantly to get familiar with the tech stack that the NYC startup scene is using. I started with making a better interface to www.mobilitywod.com videos. Then I integrated a blog so that I can have a medium to talk about my experiences as an Engineer in NYC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chose to use Ruby on Rails, which has made things very easy. There is a lot of information and strong community around Rails. In addition, &lt;em&gt;Ryan Bates&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Rails Casts Pro&lt;/em&gt; makes things even easier. Here are some of the technologies leveraged by the site:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;omniauth + twitter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;devise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;datatables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;capybara&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;twitter bootstrap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;postgres&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;factory girl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nokogiri&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nested forms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;jeykll&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nokogiri&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
