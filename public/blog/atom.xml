   <title>Taking The Leap into Fashion...Renting the Runway</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My last 10 years were spent developing trading and risk software at a top investment bank, but these days I work in fashion. I’m just finishing week two at Rent The Runway. Obviously going from Wall Street to the runway has been a big change, but so far it’s been great and I’m glad I made this decision. Moving to a startup wasn’t a choice I made lightly, and I think my experience is worth sharing as it may resonate with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was a Vice President (a senior title, but not an executive) at a great firm. I don’t care if it’s in vogue to hate on Wall Street, my employer treated me well and I respect them for that. They offered great perks like excellent training and a top notch wellness program. I had high wealth opportunities with limited risk, and I got to work with very bright people. With that said, everything wasn’t perfect, and I wasn’t 100% content with my job, but life is always about trade-offs. Everything I listed came at the cost of “Big Company Problems”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you work at big company, even at tech firms like Google, you need lots of middle management to support a large organization. That many layers leads to a few problems:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Way too many meetings. You literally have meetings to prepare for meetings. The same goes for status updates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Politics. The successful folks are jockeying to take over turf or protect their own. It may be subtle or indirect, but it still sours culture. It also leads to a lot of micro management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More than likely, you’re working with lots of proprietary frameworks or having to spend too much time managing up. The former makes you less marketable, the latter is just meta work, not value add!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greenfield opportunities are rare&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More Floaters. These are people who just skate by without taking ownership or adding significant value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That list may be short, but honestly it’s enough to weigh on you like an anchor. Since I left, I feel light a feather. I wake up excited to come work. Here are few reasons why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our Director of Engineering sets the right tone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our Tech team is nails. We are hire sharp Engineers, who care about software and taking pride in their work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The focus is on working smart, not hard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazing culture. Everyone is helpful, and there are no prima donnas!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have the critical scalability and uptime requirements of all eComerce sites, the challenges of reservation matching like ZipCar, and the logistical problems of Netflix but with much more valuable inventory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plenty of greenfield opportunities. We are disruptors!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The interview was technical, not fuzzy. If you’re interview somewhere and the interview is not as technical as you are, turn around and run!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have meetings when they are appropriate, and there is plenty of time code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Politics are nonexistent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our company is sub 200 employees, 100 are in the warehouse, and 20+ are in engineering. This means my impact is tremendous,  I get to be a steward of the culture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I understand our company’s business model. It’s not just “let’s build something cool and figure out how we monetize it”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wear what I want!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pro woman culture. I have never worked with so many women, it’s refreshing. I’m married and not sleazy; the gender balance makes the company more dynamic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you can tell, I drank the Kool-Aid. I understand if you’re skeptical as I’m still on my honeymoon, but the longer-tenured folks share my sentiment. If you like what you read here, reach out. We’re hiring!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Maven Dependencies</title>
   <link href="YOUR_URL/maven-dependencies.html"/>
   <updated>2012-11-13T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>BLOG_URL/maven-dependencies</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been using Maven and never truely understood how dependencies were resolved. Today I took the time to figure it out, so I'm going to document it here for my future reference. First off, pom files are declarative. That means the pom says I reference this jar, but not how to go about referencing the jar (though you provide some hints, i.e. remote repositories).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maven uses a waterfall methodology for looking up dependencies defined in the pom file. It looks in these places, in this order:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;local repository (~/.m2/repository)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;http://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remote Repositories listed in your pom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There is a bit more magic, if you depend on a snaphot. A snapshot means that version is actively in development and hasn't been released. In that case, maven will check for a new version remotely even if it already exists in the local repo. You can override this behaviour with the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;snapshots&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;enabled&amp;gt;true&amp;lt;/enabled&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;updatepolicy&amp;gt;{always,daily,interval:XXX,never}&amp;lt;/updatepolicy&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/snapshots&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

   <title>Rich Armstrong talks about support, culture, and management philosphy</title>
   <link href="YOUR_URL/richarmstrongtalks.html"/>
   <updated>2012-11-12T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>BLOG_URL/richarmstrongtalks</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today I heard @RichArmstrong from Fogcreek give a talk on support, culture, &amp;amp; management philosophy. The prepared presentation wasn't very long, but we spent a bunch of time doing QA. There were was a bunch of good information, but it was sort of fragmented. So this will read more like a list of interesting tidbits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding support, he spent time talking about delivery and communication. Their company ships a product, so the support team deals with external users often. He shared a story on how to tell a &lt;em&gt;Client&lt;/em&gt; there computer is unplugged. You tell them there is a wire in the back that normally collects dust, and ask them if they can unplug it and blow the dust out. While they are back there, they should notice it's unplugged. It's very indirect, and not normally my style, but I can see the value in that approach. Especially since they pay $$$ for the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a talk about email communication, and how the natural tendency is to read emails more hostile then they are intended. To overcome that, especially in the client context, error on the side of verbosity. Another trick that was mentioned is using at least 1 exclamation mark. &quot;That's great&quot;
could be taken as sarcasm, but &quot;That's great!!&quot; won't because you put extra gusto. I'm not sure I buy this, but he said it's worked and there is some science behind it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of running operational support he offered this advice:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are using cards to keep track of prioritizing work, cards with pretty pictures get done faster. It's magic engagement psychology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fix every problem two ways (immediate &amp;amp; root cause)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it won't be fixed right away, make it clear by documenting so the issue isn't raised repeatedly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Document problems right away, but wait on escalating them. What's recent always seems more important, let it settle first&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't cherry pick! i.e. have a shared inbox, and have everyone read it, and pick their issues. Everyone reading duplicates effort. Use a simple round-robin algo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you put a metric up on a board, it will move for 1.5 months. After that it stops moving, so pick a new metric!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone has authority and ownership. They can escalate up to CEO if necessary, and everyone is authorized to make refunds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make clear error pages. People will pick up the phone as soon as something isn't clear to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make design decisions clear. i.e. You have a remote with up and down arrows, which one will take you to next slide on your presentation. There is no right choice, so document it or make your design slick so it's intuitive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In terms of management &amp;amp; culture he made this points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Favor organic growth. Doubling every year, in four years, eventually Seniors are out numbered by under classmen, they will define the culture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Favor servant leadership. Show no love of power, just serve your people and the role.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need peer trust to influence any organization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give support folks dev days, days out of the support queue. Work on whatever you want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asking for account of time spent is a negative assertion. The developer puts up a wall. People don't want you in their business. Be a servant, they are the expert, help them fix the issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you make a thruput team x% more productive, that x% will get used up fast. Have a plan for that windfall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Career/Executive coaches are a wise investment: ccl.org&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have a point to make, make it on multiple occasions. i.e. Beat the drum and get a rhthym, storming the castle once won't be enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>Sandy Storm Shutin -- My blog is born</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sandy has basically shutdown NYC and the tri state area. I figured I would use the extra time at home to get my blog going. First, I need to setup the infrastructure. Since I already have a rails app, I thought it made sense to go with Jekyll for a simple static blog. It was very simple to get going, and it's forcing me to get familiar with markdown.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Hello World - About me and this site</title>
   <link href="YOUR_URL/a-test-post.html"/>
   <updated>2012-04-25T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>BLOG_URL/a-test-post</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;About Me&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I double concentrated in computer science &amp;amp; math at Columbia College in NYC. I concentrated in Math and Computer Science. A concentration is more like a minor than a major. With that said, most of the valuable stuff comes from work and few a key courses like Data Structures. Self education was key, and the best investment I ever made was in the CLRS textbook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;About the Site&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of my experience is in finance, specifically building trading systems. This means I have worked on exchange execution, desktop UIs, P&amp;amp;L tools, logistics tools, and plenty of other custom technologies to support a trading business. This means most of my experiences is in proprietary technologies, Java, and C#.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I built this site to develop experience with web applications, but more importantly to get familiar with the tech stack that the NYC startup scene is using. I started with making a better interface to www.mobilitywod.com videos. Then I integrated a blog so that I can have a medium to talk about my experiences as an Engineer in NYC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chose to use Ruby on Rails, which has made things very easy. There is a lot of information and strong community around Rails. In addition, &lt;em&gt;Ryan Bates&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Rails Casts Pro&lt;/em&gt; makes things even easier. Here are some of the technologies leveraged by the site:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;omniauth + twitter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;devise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;datatables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;capybara&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;twitter bootstrap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;postgres&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;factory girl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nokogiri&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nested forms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;jeykll&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nokogiri&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
