title: Hello World - About me and this site

#  About Me
I double concentrated in computer science & math at Columbia College in NYC. I concentrated in Math and Computer Science. A concentration is more like a minor than a major. With that said, most of the valuable stuff comes from work and few a key courses like Data Structures. Self education was key, and the best investment I ever made was in the CLRS textbook.

# About the Site
Most of my experience is in finance, specifically building trading systems. This means I have worked on exchange execution, desktop UIs, P&L tools, logistics tools, and plenty of other custom technologies to support a trading business. This means most of my experiences is in proprietary technologies, Java, and C#.

I built this site to develop experience with web applications, but more importantly to get familiar with the tech stack that the NYC startup scene is using. I started with making a better interface to www.mobilitywod.com videos. Then I integrated a blog so that I can have a medium to talk about my experiences as an Engineer in NYC.

I chose to use Ruby on Rails, which has made things very easy. There is a lot of information and strong community around Rails. In addition, *Ryan Bates* and *Rails Casts Pro* makes things even easier. Here are some of the technologies leveraged by the site:

* omniauth + twitter
* devise
* datatables
* capybara  
* twitter bootstrap
* postgres
* factory girl
* nokogiri
* nested forms
* jeykll
* Nokogiri
