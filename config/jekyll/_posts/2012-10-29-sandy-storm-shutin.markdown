title: Sandy Storm Shutin -- My blog is born
---
Sandy has basically shutdown NYC and the tri state area. I figured I would use the extra time at home to get my blog going. First, I need to setup the infrastructure. Since I already have a rails app, I thought it made sense to go with Jekyll for a simple static blog. It was very simple to get going, and it's forcing me to get familiar with markdown.
