title: Rich Armstrong talks about support, culture, and management philosphy
---

Today I heard @RichArmstrong from Fogcreek give a talk on support, culture, & management philosophy. The prepared presentation wasn't very long, but we spent a bunch of time doing QA. There were was a bunch of good information, but it was sort of fragmented. So this will read more like a list of interesting tidbits.

Regarding support, he spent time talking about delivery and communication. Their company ships a product, so the support team deals with external users often. He shared a story on how to tell a *Client* there computer is unplugged. You tell them there is a wire in the back that normally collects dust, and ask them if they can unplug it and blow the dust out. While they are back there, they should notice it's unplugged. It's very indirect, and not normally my style, but I can see the value in that approach. Especially since they pay $$$ for the product. 

There was a talk about email communication, and how the natural tendency is to read emails more hostile then they are intended. To overcome that, especially in the client context, error on the side of verbosity. Another trick that was mentioned is using at least 1 exclamation mark. "That's great"
could be taken as sarcasm, but "That's great!!" won't because you put extra gusto. I'm not sure I buy this, but he said it's worked and there is some science behind it.

In terms of running operational support he offered this advice:

* If you are using cards to keep track of prioritizing work, cards with pretty pictures get done faster. It's magic engagement psychology.
* Fix every problem two ways (immediate & root cause)
* If it won't be fixed right away, make it clear by documenting so the issue isn't raised repeatedly
* Document problems right away, but wait on escalating them. What's recent always seems more important, let it settle first
* Don't cherry pick! i.e. have a shared inbox, and have everyone read it, and pick their issues. Everyone reading duplicates effort. Use a simple round-robin algo.
* If you put a metric up on a board, it will move for 1.5 months. After that it stops moving, so pick a new metric!
* Everyone has authority and ownership. They can escalate up to CEO if necessary, and everyone is authorized to make refunds.
* Make clear error pages. People will pick up the phone as soon as something isn't clear to them.
* Make design decisions clear. i.e. You have a remote with up and down arrows, which one will take you to next slide on your presentation. There is no right choice, so document it or make your design slick so it's intuitive.

	
In terms of management & culture he made this points:	

* Favor organic growth. Doubling every year, in four years, eventually Seniors are out numbered by under classmen, they will define the culture. 
* Favor servant leadership. Show no love of power, just serve your people and the role. 
* You need peer trust to influence any organization.
* Give support folks dev days, days out of the support queue. Work on whatever you want.
* Asking for account of time spent is a negative assertion. The developer puts up a wall. People don't want you in their business. Be a servant, they are the expert, help them fix the issues.
* If you make a thruput team x% more productive, that x% will get used up fast. Have a plan for that windfall.
* Career/Executive coaches are a wise investment: ccl.org
* If you have a point to make, make it on multiple occasions. i.e. Beat the drum and get a rhthym, storming the castle once won't be enough.
